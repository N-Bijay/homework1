What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
The difference between a merge and a rebase is that a merge preserves the commit history 
of both branches while combining the changes from the source branch to the 
target branch. A rebase rewrites the commit history to begin at the start 
of the target branch. It still merges, the branches, but does so in a way 
that creates a clear linear history.

What is a remote repository? 
A remote repository is a server that stores code. The server can be at any location, as long as it is accessible over 
the internet.
